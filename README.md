# DAA-LAB JSSSTU (20IS46L)


This repository contains programs written in **C++** as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory (20IS46L)** for **JSS Science and Technology University - Information Science and Engineering**.  
These programs cover Different Algorithms and Problems.

---

1. Sort a given set of elements using the Quicksort method and determine the time 
required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the 
number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n. 
The elements can be read from a file or can be 
generated using the random number generator. 

2. Implement a parallelized Merge Sort algorithm to sort a given set of elements and 
determine the time required to sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different 
values of n, the number of elements in the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time 
taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using the 
random number generator. 
 
3. Implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming.

4. Find a subset of a given set S = {sl, s2,. ,sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal 
to a given positive integer d. For example, if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 
there aretwo solutions {1,2,6}and{1,8}.A suitable message is to be displayed if the given 
probleminstance doesn’t have a solution.

5. Implement N Queen’s problem using Back Tracking.

6. Implement any scheme to find the optimal solution for the Traveling Salesperson 
problem and then solve the same problem instance using any approximation algorithm 
and determine the error in the approximation. 

7. a) Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using BFS 
method.
7. b) Check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method.

8. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices 
using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

9. Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths Problem using Floyd’s algorithm.

10. a) Obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph.
10. b) Compute the transitive closure of a given directed graph using Warshall’s algorithm.

11. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.

12. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given undirected graph using Prim’s algorithm.
